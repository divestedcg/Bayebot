/**
 * <p>Defines an interface for the classification of Strings.</p>
 *
 * <p>Use the isMatch method if you want true/false matching, or use the
 * classify method if you match probability.</p>
 *
 * <p>The isMatch method will return a boolean representing if a string
 * matches whatever criteria the implmentation is matching on. In the
 * default implemnetation this is done by calling classify and checking
 * if the returned match probability is greater than or equal to DEFAULT_CUTOFF.</p>
 *
 * <p>The classify method will return a double value representing the
 * likelyhood that the string passed to it is a match on whatever
 * criteria the implmentation is matching on.</p>
 *
 * <p>When implementing this class, it is recommended that
 * the classify method should not return the values 1 or 0
 * except in the cases there the classifier can guarentee that the string is
 * a match doe does not match. For non-absolute matching algorithms LOWER_BOUND
 * and UPPER_BOUND should be used.</p>
